# PYTHON Learning Repository

Welcome to the PYTHON Learning Repository! 

This repository contains Python scripts that I am creating and collecting as I learn more through diverses courses.

## Repository Structure

It's arranged in numerical order of import to github, not study order.

Scripts are put in two formats: [a] ipynb and [b] py

Same numbers represent same script [a and b] and complementary files [c, d, e...].
